[[redirects]]
  # Redirect all traffic to index.html for client-side routing (if used)
  # or just let it serve static files.
  # Since we have specific html files (serveradmin.html, etc.), we might not need SPA redirect
  # unless we are using a router.
  # But for clean URLs or fallbacks:
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
  force = false  # Only redirect if file doesn't exist

# We don't need API proxy rewrites because we are using absolute URLs in apiEndpoints.js
# pointing to Render services directly (CORS is enabled on backend).
